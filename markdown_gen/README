usage
./taball.sh <source path> <destination path>

The script loops through all the .csv files in the source directory
and runs them into tabulate.py. The csv must be of the following format:

<Group Label>, <Byte Offset>, <SPN Name>, <SPN Length>

One entry per line, the first row shall be data, not column titles. 


Alternatively, the python script can be run independent of the bash script, 
if you only want to run this on one file.

usage
python tabulate.py <source path> <destination path>

The same format constraints for the input csv file apply
